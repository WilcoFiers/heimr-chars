Players should know all of the rules in this chapter before attending a Heimr LARP based on this rule set. Any character specific abilities are documented in the rest of the document. These do not require memorising.</p>\n\n<p>The Heimr LARP is designed to create a highly immersive game environment, in which players can bring their characters to life.

      "sectionName": "Safety",
      "sectionPath": "core-rules/safety",
      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Safety</h1>\n  <p>Safety is one of the most important things to consider for live roleplaying events. Since there are a multitude of dangers involved, there are several rules covering safety during an event.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc1\">General</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, follow any directions given to you by a game master. They have the final say concerning the safety at an event. Ignoring any safety instructions from a Game Master may lead to your removal from an event. Apart from that, try to use common sense when confronted with dangerous situations. When in doubt, try to choose the safest option. Finally, whenever any party indicates they do not want to continue, you should stop whatever you are doing and check to make sure everyone is fine.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc2\">Physical Contact</h2>\n<p>Live roleplaying is a game that usually involves a certain level of physical contact. For example, combat involves fighting and hitting with mock weaponry. Therefore, light physical contact is always allowed as long as it is appropriate. You should be aware other players can also initiate this contact at any moment, including when you do not expect it.</p>\n\n<p>Other than the afore mentioned light contact, other things are not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, grabbing someone, wrestling and .pulling or pushing. Should you agree with someone before combat starts you are allowed to take things further.</p>\n\n<p>You should never actually bind someone&apos;s legs, hands or other body parts. Instead, place something over the body part you want to bind and state to the person you have bound that he is bound.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc3\">Safety Calls</h2>\n<p>There are two safety-related calls that you should know by heart. These are <em><strong>Man Down</strong></em> and <em><strong>No Play</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>You should call <em><strong>Man Down</strong></em> if you or another player require immediate medical attention. When this happens the game is stopped so that medical personnel can attend the injured player. If you are near the injured player you should keep shouting Man down! and wave your arm until medical personnel knows where to go.</p>\n\n<p>If you hear somebody call Man down! you should stop playing and sit down. Do not repeat the man down call otherwise confusion may arise as to the actual location of the injured person. You are only allowed to move if you are in the way of medical personnel. The game will resume after medical personnel have given the &apos;all clear&apos;.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>No Play</strong></em> should be called when a player has trouble coping with the mental or emotional stress of the game. Live roleplay events can be tough on a person. Your character is likely to go through stressful experiences which can effect a player personally. If a player calls <em><strong>No Play</strong></em> this means they are out of character and require some space. You may continue the game without this character, or pause the game temporarily.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc4\">Combat</h2>\n<p>The primary element regarding combat safety are the weapons. All melee weapons used during the event should LARP-safe weapons made of foam with a glass fibre core and latex coating. All weapons should be checked by a Game Master before the event. If a Game Master deems a weapon unsafe, you are not allowed to use the weapon.</p>\n\n<p>During combat, you should pay attention not to target the head, crotch or other sensitive parts of your opponent. Never thrust with your weapon unless it has a special thrusting head. Do not put your full force behind your attacks, but instead pull them back slightly before hitting. Finally, try and be aware of your environment during combat and try to prevent anyone from tripping or falling onto tree stumps, tent lines or other harmful objects.</p>\n\n<p>Should you feel someone is fighting in an unsafe way, feel free to inform a game master of this. They can discuss this with the other person.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc5\">Ranged Weapons</h3>\n<p>Throwing weapons should consist of a soft foam coated with latex. Most importantly, they should not have a rigid core. For bows and crossbows, you can use anything with a strength of up to 30 pounds. Arrows should be LARP-safe with a soft head.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc6\">Shields and Armour</h3>\n<p>Shields should consist of a foam core with a latex coating. Shields with a wood core are explicitly not allowed.</p>\n\n<p>While most armour will be fine when fighting, you should pay attention to avoid dangerous protrusions like spikes or sharp edges on your armour. Should you wish to have such features on your armour, create them from foam and latex or in another combat safe method.</p>\n\n  ",

      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Game Progression</h1>\n  <p>LARP games should progress smoothly, without big interruptions. This chapter explains the mechanisms used in Heimr to prevent the game from stalling.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc7\">Game Masters</h2>\n<p>Game Masters are the directors of the game. They make sure the story progresses as it should and direct the NPCs to that end. Game masters are also there to help you if you are unsure about the rules and to referee when players have a conflict. You should follow the instructions the Game Master gives.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not agree with a ruling you may make one, and only one, appeal to the Game master. If he or she is not convinced by your argument, the ruling is final and the game continues. You may discuss the issue after the game.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc8\">Time Calls</h2>\n<p>There are four time calls. These calls can only be made by a Game master:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><em><strong>Time Freeze</strong></em>: The game stops and every player must close his or her eyes while humming to drown out any noise</li>\n    <li><em><strong>Time Stop</strong></em>: The game stops. The calling Game Master usually has some instructions for you after this.</li>\n    <li><em><strong>Time In</strong></em>: The game restarts</li>\n    <li><em><strong>Time Out</strong></em>: The game stops completely</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc9\">Raised Hand</h2>\n<p>A raised hand indicates that this person is out of character and should be ignored. You may only do this with permission of a game master.</p>\n\n  ",

      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Characters</h1>\n  <p>There are four things that make up a character: Hit points, Willpower, Skills and Conditions. These thing will be explained in this chapter. Which and how many a character has depends on things such as race and equipment. Instructions on how to create a character can be found in the Character Guide at www.heimr.nl/game_rules/.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc10\">Hit Points</h2>\n<p>Hit points (HP) represent the likelihood of a character surviving an attack. They are <strong>not</strong> &quot;health points&quot; and do <strong>not</strong> represent the physical health of your character. Things that increase your chance of survival, such as armour or a strong body, can increase your hit points. When a character is hit by an attack, they (usually) lose 1 HP. If a character reaches 0 or fewer hit points, <strong>only than</strong> he or she becomes truly injured. As long as you have more then 0 HP you are not injured (Although you might have sore spots, scraps, small cuts, old wounds, etc) Uninjured characters can restore hit points by taking a &quot;short rest&quot;. For more information about HP, short rest and dying see the &quot;health&quot; section.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc11\">Willpower</h2>\n<p>Willpower (WP) is a character&apos;s way of pushing through tough situations or achieving extraordinary things. It represents your mental, emotional and physical stamina all in one. When your character is losing WP he or she is probably going through something emotional. When you character is spending WP on skills he or she is doing the best they can.</p>\n\n<p>Characters with high WP are usually motivated and in high spirits, whereas characters with low WP might be more inclined to give up and surrender to the situation. Once per day you can regain 1 WP by doing something you enjoy (see your racial condition). Other characters might have skills that will help you feel better and regain WP. Or you can buy items for this purpose.</p>\n\n<p>You are free to roleplay your WP (or lack thereof) as you see fit and realistic.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc12\">Divine charge</h2>\n<p>Every character gains 2 divine charge (DC) at dawn up to a maximum of 2. This represents the energy your soul generates that religious leaders can use during ceremonies. Such religious leaders usually ask you to join in such ceremonies every day. You will receive cards provided by the event organization to represent these DC.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc13\">Skills</h2>\n<p>Skills let you fight better, help others, create items, etc. Players must carry skill cards for every skill they have. These are provided by the event organization. Do not use the skill if you do not have the card. A description of the skill is provided on the skill card. You can only use one skill at a time. Using a skill may cost one or more WP. A skill can override rules in this rule-book for individual characters.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc14\">Conditions</h2>\n<p>A condition is a character&apos;s state of being. This may be physical, mental or social state. The event organization will provide cards for all conditions. Players must carry all condition cards of their character. Conditions include such things as race, social disorders, disfigurement and contacts. A condition can override rules in this rule-book for individual characters.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc15\">Counters on cards</h2>\n<p>For some skill, condition and item cards you have to keep a counter. This is simply a number that it put on the corresponding card with pen or pencil. If the card become unreadable ask for a replacement from a GM.</p>\n\n  ",

Effects can be called by characters or by a Game master. Effects have a default number. If a number is called with the effect, use this number instead of the default. With <em><strong>Hit</strong></em> the number indicates how much hp you lose and with <em><strong>Break</strong></em> the number indicates how strong the <em><strong>break</strong></em> effect was. These have a default of 1. With all other effects the number following the effect is the number of seconds it lasts (default 2).</p>\n\n<p>For example <em><strong>Stumble 4</strong></em> is a <em><strong>stumble</strong></em> effect that lasts 4 seconds and <em><strong>hit 2</strong></em> is a <em><strong>hit</strong></em> effect that causes you to lose 2 HP.</p>\n\n<p>An effect always works when it is called. Players are thus not allowed to call an effect when they are not sure all the requirements needed to call it are met.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc17\">Weapons</h2>\n<p>In Heimr LARP any character can wield any weapon, as long as he has an item card and physrep for it. When you are hit by a weapon you lose 1 HP unless an effect is called while you are hit with the weapon. So the effect replaces this 1 HP damage if an effect is called.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc18\">Movement and Restraint</h2>\n<p>Some characters can not move, or do not want to be moved. Do not go tugging or pushing people. To keep it friendly the following rules apply:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>One character can move a willing character with a leg injury</li>\n    <li>Two characters can move an character unable to stand and resist</li>\n    <li>Three characters can move an unwilling bound character</li>\n    <li>Four characters can move an unwilling character</li>\n</ul>\n\n  ",

      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Health</h1>\n  <p>A character&apos;s health is of critical importance. This chapter explains what you can do to stay healthy, and what will happen if you do not. Skills for healing can be found in the various domains.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc19\">Short Rests</h2>\n<p>By taking a short rest, characters who have <strong>more</strong> than 0 HP can restore all their HP. Characters who are injured (0 or less HP) can <strong>not</strong> take a short rest. The short rest must be uninterrupted for at least five minutes. During this time a character may not use skills, engage in combat, do physically straining activities such as running, get upset or angry. Any player that is not very active will find themselves meeting the conditions of being <strong>at rest</strong> most of the time.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc20\">Injury effects</h2>\n<p>When a character is hit with an attack that causes the HP to become 0 or lower the character becomes injured. When a character becomes injured they receive an effect based on what body part got hit by the attack. The effect lasts as long as the character is injured. Characters can have additional effects from injuries, if they are hit on multiple body parts while injured. The effects are as followed:</p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Location</th>\n        <td>Effect</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Either arm</th>\n        <td><em><strong>Drop item</strong></em></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Leg(s)</th>\n        <td><em><strong>Fall </strong></em></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Torso</th>\n        <td><em><strong>Daze </strong></em></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc21\">Injuries</h2>\n<p>There are three levels of injury, depending on how low your HP is. The three levels are:</p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <td></td>\n        <th>HP</th>\n        <th>Resulting injury</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Bloodied</th>\n        <td>0</td>\n        <td>This injury requires treatment but is not life threatening.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Mangled</th>\n        <td>-1</td>\n        <td>The character is bleeding to death.

You can leave your unconscious character behind. To do so, leave an article of clothing of roughly the length of your body, in the place where your character lays. Leave behind all your item cards, money and your racial condition. Items can be stolen by taking the item cards. You can kill an unconscious character that has no player present, by ripping their racial condition.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc23\">Dying</h2>\n<p>If your character dies you should remain lying on the spot for as long as necessary for people to finish interacting with your remains. Always leave behind all your item cards and money. After this you should go see a game master to create a new character or help the team by becoming an DC (directed character).</p>\n\n  ",

      "sectionName": "Items",
      "sectionPath": "core-rules/items",
      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Items</h1>\n  <p>Items are things of value which characters own in the game. They range from weapons to magical devices and everything in between. Most items are represented by a physical representation and an item card.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc0\">Item Card</h2>\n<p>Item cards describe the in-game properties of an item. On an item card you can find the item&apos;s name, its price and other details like the effect given to the wielder. The item card must carried by the player that is in possession of the item. Any object that does not have an item card does not have any special in-game properties and can be used for decoration only, apart from weapon physreps which are not allowed in the game area without an item card.</p>\n\n<p>Item cards can have &quot;markers&quot; on them. These are small stickers attached to the item card to indicate certain special things happened to an item. For example, a broken sword has a &quot;broken&quot; marker attached to the item card to indicate its broken state.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc1\">Market Price</h3>\n<p>Each item card has a market price. The market price is the price of the item when buying it during downtime. For details about buying and selling items, see the <em>Downtime Periods</em> rules. Some items will have a market price of &quot;Var&quot;, these have special rules governing their market price that will be described in the item&apos;s description.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc2\">Large Items</h3>\n<p>Large items are those that are too heavy or unwieldy to easily carry around. These items will be marked with &quot;Large&quot; on the item card.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc3\">Toughness</h3>\n<p>Many items have a toughness value on their item card. This number indicates how difficult it is to break that item in such a way that it becomes useless. If an item has a toughness of 0, any character can destroy it simply by smashing it. Any item with a toughness of 1 or higher can only be destroyed by the <em><strong>break</strong></em> effect. If the <em><strong>break</strong></em> is equal to or stronger than the item&apos;s toughness, it is destroyed. For example a sword with toughness 2 can only be broken with a <em><strong>break 2</strong></em> or higher effect.</p>\n\n<p>When an item is destroyed you must mark its item card with a &quot;broken&quot; marker and can no longer use the item until it is repaired.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc4\">Consumables</h3>\n<p>Certain items will be marked as &quot;consumable&quot; on their item cards. These items are considered consumables and will generally provide a single benefit after which they are consumed. Consumed items cannot be used again, you should mark the item card with a &quot;consumed&quot; marker. You can then give the item card back to a GM.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc5\">Physical Representation</h2>\n<p>A physical representation or &quot;physrep&quot; for short, is an object that looks like the item it represents in the game. Every item, unless otherwise noted in the item&apos;s description, requires a physrep. For most items, you are free to choose a physrep that resembles the item as closely as possible, although the item&apos;s description may contain a suggestion. However, some items will be marked as having special physrep requirements. These requirements will be specified in the item&apos;s extended description in the rule book. Note that you cannot use the same physrep for multiple items.</p>\n\n<p>You are allowed to carry one item for which you have no physrep. This is a concealed item. If a player searches you for concealed items you must show the item card from the concealed item. A Large item may not be concealed, this will be marked on the item card.</p>\n\n<p>One large item can be carried in your hands without a physrep. You should indicate you are carrying an item by holding your hands out in front of you, with the card resting on your palms. You should take this item to a concealed location as soon as possible and leave it there until you acquire a suitable physrep.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc6\">Trading and Stealing Items</h2>\n<p>Stealing, looting or exchanging items should be done by exchanging the item card. Do not take another player&apos;s physreps without their permission. If you steal an item you must take the item card and attach it to your own physrep. Because most items can be concealed (no physrep), you can steal something without having the physrep with you.</p>\n\n<p>If a physrep is on the player&apos;s body you must remove the physrep before you can take the item card. For example if you want to steal someone&apos;s chain mail you should actually get him out of it, before you can take the item card. Difficult to remove items (like a chain mail) can only be removed from unconscious or willing characters. The unconscious character&apos;s player must help removing the item. Alternatively, spend a few minutes tugging and moving things on an unconscious character to indicate you are removing the item, without actually removing the physrep.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc7\">Carrying Capacity</h2>\n<p>Generally, you are allowed to carry as many items as you can carry physreps for. For large items, consider that while your physrep may not be very heavy, the item it represents something heavy or unwieldy, so try to limit how many large items you carry. As a rule of thumb, carry one extra large item in addition to those you actively use.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling to or from an event, you can carry up to 50 items. Any item marked as &quot;Large&quot; takes the place of 8 items.</p>\n\n  ",

      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Creating a Character</h1>\n  <p>To create a new character, you must go through the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Pick the race of your character</li>\n    <li>Choose skills and conditions from the domains (20 points)</li>\n    <li>Buy items for your character (500 copper)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc29\">Character races</h2>\n<p>Every character must start by choosing a race. All racial conditions for Heimr are listed in the Character Card chapter. For some races, more then one racial condition is available. This gives players more diversity in portraying characters of the same race. When you&apos;ve chosen a racial condition, move on to selecting domains.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc30\">Domains</h2>\n<p>A domain is a collection of skills, items, conditions and down time options. Every domain has its own theme and challenges players in a different way. You can choose skills from as many domains as you like. We recommend using 1 to 3 domains for a character. To get an idea of what the domains are about, read their introduction. Some domains may suite you better then others. Currently, the following domains are available:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Defence (Armour, defences against effects, shields)</li>\n    <li>Armed Combat (Weapons, offensive skills)</li>\n    <li>Battlefield Surgery (Saving dying people and binding wounds)</li>\n    <li>Divine Magic (Priests who can take the power of worship and transform them into blessings and other miracles)</li>\n    <li>The marketplace (Traders, craftsmen, money lenders, etc)</li>\n    <li>Alchemy (Scientists and potion brewers that use ingredients to create substances to influence people)</li>\n    <li>Primordial magic (Mages who can manipulate the very matter of reality by weaving rune powered automata)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc31\">Skills and Conditions</h2>\n<p>From the domains you&apos;ve selected you can start picking skills and conditions. Most characters start with 20 points which they can spend on skills and conditions. You can convert up to 5 of these points to extra money for your character. For every point you get 100 copper.</p>\n\n<p>Some skills and conditions are divided into multiple levels. The higher the level the more powerful and expensive the skill. You can not choose skills or conditions more then once. This includes skills and conditions of different levels.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc32\">Items and Money</h2>\n<p>Characters have 500 copper to buy items for their new character. You can choose items from any domain, though you probably won&apos;t have much use for items from domains you don&apos;t have skills or conditions from except for Armed combat, since most characters will at least buy some kind of weapon and armour. Unlike many role playing games you do not require skills to use weapons or armour. Every character has basic training in every weapon and armour type.</p>\n\n<p>Every item has a market price. The market price is the price of an item when you buy it from a store during character creation.</p>\n\n<p>You can use any copper you haven&apos;t spend as starting capital for your character.</p>\n\n  ",

But she was sure it had saved her life just now.</em></p>\n\n<p>Armed combat is the domain that gives characters the offensive items and skills used on the medieval battlefield. These give you the prerequisites your character needs in an attack, such as a weapon, shield and armour.

After a battle surgeons and their assistants franticly work to save the lives of those who lay dying. Treating injuries on the battlefield is a race against the clock. You will likely encounter situations where there will be more patients then you can treat.</p>\n\n<p>It is up to surgeons and their assistants to quickly decide how to spread their resources. Do you try to save everyone? Should you focus on those most likely to survive? Surgeons and assistants must work coordinated, and you&apos;ll likely do it under pressure of the friends of those who&apos;s life you&apos;re trying to save.</p>\n\n<p>Treating injuries is divided up into two stages. If the injury is life threatening, the first step is to stabilize the patient so they will not bleed to death. You can use the battlefield surgery skill to do this. When the patient is stable you can then stitch and bandage the wound to close it.</p>\n\n<p>In the first stage. The battlefield surgery stage, the surgeon picks a card at random from a deck of cards that they carry with them. This card determines how many willpower the patient loses (affected by the skill of the surgeon and the size of the team working on the patient) and whether or not the patient dies from his or her wounds.</p>\n\n<p>In the second stage. The stitching and bandaging stage, the healer picks a card at random from a different deck of cards and this card determines whether or not the wound gets infected.</p>\n\n<p>After the wound has been stitched and bandaged the slow process of healing actually begins.

Divine magic works by adjusting the physical laws of the world around people and objects. To power their magic, deities need to collect divine charge from the world. For this purpose, deities need to have mortals representing them on the world, fighting for their cause. These are the priests and the crusaders of this domain.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc50\">Divine Charge</h3>\n<p>The energy source of all divine magic are divine charges (DC). There are several ways to get DC. If you have a Devoted condition, the easiest way is by gathering worshippers and getting them to pray during a divine ceremony, to an emblem or at a shrine. During such ceremonies divine charges are released most of which are send to your deity, you can use the rest to cast blessings or power the ceremony itself. How much you keep depends on your devotion. Another way to get divine charge is through certain ceremonies.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc51\">Priest skills</h3>\n<p>The ceremony master skill gives you access to most priest ceremonies (not the blessing ceremony) and gives you a discount on such ceremonies.</p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Skill</th>\n        <td><strong>Ceremony Master</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Points</th>\n        <td>2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>WP</th>\n        <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Unique Rule</th>\n        <td>You can perform priest ceremonies by spending the necessary components and 1WP.

The most important one of these ceremonies is the &quot;blessing&quot; ceremony which gives you access to blessings to empower yourself and your flock.

When a blessing is cast the recipient of the blessings gets a condition card from the caster describing the blessing.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc60\">Casting Blessings</h3>\n<p>Blessings are cast during the blessing ceremony (see the ceremonies section). Before casting a blessing, ask the recipient if they will accept your blessing. How exactly you cast a blessing is up to you, for example: you could offer them some medium through which the blessing is transferred. This medium can be many things, for example a mark of blood, a sprinkle of water, inhaling the incense smoke or a simple touch. You could say a few lines of prayer or a few other appropriate words.</p>\n\n<p>The DC it costs to cast a blessing is detailed on the blessing condition but &quot;signature&quot; blessings do not cost DC. You want to carry the conditions for the blessings that you want to cast before you start the ceremony. If you have run out of the blessing conditions you need you can always ask a GM for more.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc61\">Signature blessings</h3>\n<p>These are small signature blessings that do not cost DC to cast for a priest of the proper deity and are usually handed out as a reward by such priest in exchange for the DC. They can only be cast for free by a priest of that particular deity or they can be bestowed upon worshippers if they leave DC at some holy items.</p>\n\n\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Blessing</th>\n        <td><strong>Last words (Talor)</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>DC</th>\n        <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Unique Rule</th>\n        <td>When you die you can contact 1 nearby person in a vision today, they regain three WP.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Shared Rule</th>\n        <td>This blessing costs no DC to cast if you are devoted to Talor and the recipient has no blessing.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Shared Rule</th>\n        <td>This blessing expires at dawn or when you receive another blessing.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Details</th>\n        <td><em>When you die you will have the ability to speak to one person for the last time.</em></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Blessing</th>\n        <td><strong>Tradable knowledge (Talor)</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>DC</th>\n        <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Unique Rule</th>\n        <td>Ask a DM for additional rumours and news.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Shared Rule</th>\n        <td>This blessing costs no DC to cast if you are devoted to Talor and the recipient has no blessing.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Shared Rule</th>\n        <td>This blessing expires at dawn or when you receive another blessing.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Details</th>\n        <td><em>You hear whispers on the wind.</em></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Blessing</th>\n        <td><strong>Zest for life (Danu)</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>DC</th>\n        <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Unique Rule</th>\n        <td>It takes 2 more minutes for you to bleed to death.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Shared Rule</th>\n        <td>This blessing costs no DC to cast if you are devoted to Danu and the recipient has no blessing.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Shared Rule</th>\n        <td>This blessing expires at dawn or when you receive another blessing.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Details</th>\n        <td><em>Your will to live heightens by this blessing.</em></td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n        <th>Blessing</th>\n        <td><strong>Blessed union (Danu)</strong></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>DC</th>\n        <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Unique Rule</th>\n        <td>Unless something prevents it.

He felt strangely light headed from the fumes. But it was done. He closed his notes and put the flask to his lips. For a few seconds nothing happened, but after a while the world began to turn a strange hue of purple and the spirits stepped forward. &quot;You can see us now. Or is it your head playing with you? Or is it us playing with your head?&quot; The alchemist answered slowly &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot; and the spirit replied with a grin &quot;Would it matter if you did?&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>Alchemy is the art of purifying, mixing and testing ingredients to reach a certain wanted effect on the body. It is a strange mixture of magic and science and a highly local affair. A travelling alchemist almost always needs to come up with new recipes based on the local ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>This is a complex domain. It is not as complex as primordial magic but comes close. The various steps one might(!) undertake in making a potion are the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Gather information about the local ingredients by reading in character documents.</li>\n    <li>Find where the local ingredients grow.</li>\n    <li>Gather (or direct others to gather) a few of the ingredients to test with.</li>\n    <li>Wear plant parts on your skin or (when you are feeling daring) consume some small portions to see if you can gather hints about their effects.</li>\n    <li>Test the ingredients with testing substances that are more accurate than wearing them on your skin but are more expensive as well.</li>\n    <li>Test the ingredients on animals, which might give you additional clues... but animals work slightly different than the fifteen races.</li>\n    <li>Test the ingredients directly on a person... the only way to be sure.</li>\n    <li>Cut, cook, mortar, filter, press or distil the ingredients to make sure you have a concentrated ingredients, with as limited side effects as possible.</li>\n    <li>Mix the ingredients with known catalysts to increase the speed at which the effect will take hold.</li>\n    <li>Mix the ingredients with known anti-catalysts to suppress the speed at which the side effects arrive, or to eliminate them all together.</li>\n    <li>Test your newly mixture in any way you want before consuming it yourself or letting one of your friends consume it.</li>\n    <li>Try the new recipe. (After this test you will receive full information from the DM&apos;s on your newly created potion)</li>\n    <li>Write down the recipe, name the new potion, and formalize this process by gathering a lot of ingredients and creating a lot of the potions.</li>\n    <li>Use preservation substances to keep the potions from spoiling so you can sell them after the event or use them on later events.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course you could disregard this careful method and simply gather various dangerous plants in a cauldron and hope the mixture doesn&apos;t kill your client or yourself.</p>\n\n<p>If you play an alchemist you will need a stock booklet in which you write down how many of each ingredient or mixtures you have. If you mix two ingredients together you do not need to consult a GM. Simply write down the new mixture in you stock booklet and note how many you mixed.</p>\n\n<p>This is an example of how you could write a short entry into a stock booklet (and some personal notes):</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Polistrum plant: 0 (I cut them all up and don&apos;t have any raw plants anymore... should gather some)</li>\n    <li>Polistrum roots: 10 (gained by cutting up Polistrum plants... I threw away the rest of the plants because only the roots have an effect I want)</li>\n    <li>Cooked Polistrum roots: 3 (Gained by cooking the roots. The fumes that came from it contained some of the side effects that I wanted to get rid of).</li>\n    <li>Filtrate of distilled polistrum roots oil: 6 (After pressing oil from the roots I filtered and finally distilled the oil. Now it should have the most concentrated form of the effect I want).</li>\n    <li>Filtrate of distilled polistrum roots oil + filtrate of Hypotrem leaves oil mixture: 6 (I added the filtered Hypotrem leaves oil to counter some of the nasty side effects. The side effects are not gone completely... but at least they will only kick in after the positive effects of the potion are long gone anyway.)</li>\n    <li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can mix ingredients freely as long as you note the mixture in your stock booklet in such a way that you can reproduce your steps (as seen in the above example).</p>",

Then, drawing on the power in the staff she carried with her she added to this power even more. Waving a complex series of gestures while speaking ancient words to harness the last bit of energy within her she was ready to unleash the automata. The entire little dance had not taking longer than a few seconds and it was almost a rote action at this point. The winds around her picked up paste and the duelling mage in front of her was knocked on his back, losing his concentration on the, doubtlessly more powerful, spell he was preparing. But now that he had fallen down she had time to cast her truly offensive automata. It would all be over soon.</em></p>\n\n<p>Primordial magic is the domain that gives you the ability to manipulate the five elements, the very building blocks of matters. The primordial magic domain enables you to create your own spells trough an extensive system called automata crafting. But if you want you can play a mage with the spells that are already in the system, or build by other players.</p>\n\n<p>This domain has many skills, conditions and items that give you ways to conjure up power. With this power you can power your automata (or spells) to alter reality around you.</p>",

      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Automata</h1>\n  <p>Automata are a collection of glyphs that can be triggered to produce an effect.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc71\">Inscribing Automata</h2>\n<p>Inscribing is the process of writing down the glyphs to create a new automata. To inscribe a new automata you take a number of glyphs and combine them on a hexagonal grid. The size and shape of this grid depends on the object you are inscribing. The available glyphs are listed on the <a href=\"/node/1971\">glyphs</a> page. Note that automata can only be inscribed on imbued items, which have been specially crafted so they can be inscribed. Inscribed automata can be removed from an item with the Imbue skill.</p>\n\n<p>Each automata needs to be written on a surface consisting of hexagons oriented with the straight edges up. Each hexagon should be 2cm by 1.5cm. The size of the grid is the amount of surface of the object you are inscribing. Note that in the case of very thin objects like paper sheets only one side can be used. You are allowed to use a paper to represent the surface of the object when inscribing things like wands.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc72\">Rules</h3>\n<p>Each automata has to follow a certain set of rules. These rules were created by the original creators of primordial magic and serve as an abstraction on reality to make it possible to - literally - create magic effects.</p>\n\n<p>To start the inscribing process, pick a starting grid tile and place the &quot;Begin&quot; glyph. Put other glyphs adjacent to the start glyph or other glyphs such that it will eventually produce the desired effect. It is very important during this process is to account for how the power flows through the glyphs: From the &quot;Begin&quot; glyph, the power will flow to the other glyphs in a single chain. The next glyph to be powered will be determined by starting from the top of the current glyph and moving clockwise. The first glyph that is encountered will be the next glyph to be powered. The previous glyph, take and put glyphs are excluded from this process. Should another, previously powered glyph be encountered this way the automata will short-cirtuit and be disintegrated.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc73\">Input and Output</h3>\n<p>Each glyph can have at most two inputs and one output. However, it depends on the glyph whether or not it will actually use an input or produce an output. To find the inputs, the same clockwise lookup is performed as for the next glyph except that Take glyphs are included. If the previous glyph produced an output, it is also included in the lookup. The first such glyph encountered is assigned to the first input of the next glyph, the second glyph is assigned to the second input.</p>\n\n<p>For outputs, the surrounding glyphs are searched for a Put glyph using the same clockwise lookup. The first such glyph encountered will be used to put the value produced by the glyph. If there is no Put glyph, the value will be available for the next glyph to use. If nothing is done with the value, it will be lost.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc74\">Picking</h3>\n<p>Certain glyphs allow you to &quot;pick&quot; something. This represents a collection of Glyphs that your character knows that share a common design but have slightly varying parameters. Picking the parameters for the glyph does not mean creating a new glyph, but rather means that you know a glyph of that type with the chosen permutations. For example, the <em>Create Particles</em> glyph needs you to pick an amount and a type. If you need 5 Fire particles, you can pick &quot;5&quot; for the number and &quot;Fire&quot; for the type, which results in a &quot;Create 5 Fire&quot; glyph.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc75\">Dominance</h3>\n<p>Some glyphs are marked as &quot;Dominant&quot; with a certain element. If more than 50% of the power of your automata is spent on dominant glyphs of the same type and there are no glyphs of the opposite of that type, the automata will become dominant of that type. This can have certain benefits, most importantly it allows certain skills to provide you with bonuses.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc76\">The Effect</h3>\n<p>The end result of the automata - the effect, needs to be put into game terms once you are satisfied with your automata. To do this, contact a Game Master and hand him or her your automata. The game master will check it for you and then hand you a closed note with the effect in game terms. You can open and read the note the first time you activate the automata.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc77\">Activating Automata</h2>\n<p>To activate an automata, you have to put enough power into it. Each automata comes with a power cost that needs to be matched. The power cost of the automata depends on the glyphs used for the automata. You need to be able to touch the automata with one of your hands to be able to put the required power into it.</p>\n\n<p>The source of the power used to activate the automata depends on the components you use. See <a href=\"/node/1968\">components</a> for a detailed list of all available components and how to use them. Once an automata has been activated, the automata creates an effect either at the palm of one of your hands or at a point of the object the automata was inscribed upon, as decided during activation. The effect persists for a certain duration, then dissipates. How long the effect persists depends on several things, primarily on what type of matter - if any - is used. Please see &quot;Stability and Radiation&quot; for more details.</p>\n\n  ",

      "html": "<h1 class=\"book-heading\">Example Automata</h1>\n  <p>To create an automata several steps have to be taken. This page provides an example automata and the process to create it.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc78\">Effect</h2>\n<p>To start off, we need to decide what kind of effect we want to achieve with the automata. For this example, we will create an automata producing a simple <em>Stumble</em> effect for two seconds and can be used during combat on touch.</p>\n\n<p>With the effect decided upon, we need to decide how to produce this effect. There are many ways of producing a stumble effect, for example you could produce a gust of wind to push someone back, try to push someone backwards using pure force, make him feel like there is something ahead of him that he needs to get back from. However, one very simple way of producing the effect is using a property of the matter mages work with: Combining two opposing particle types annihilates them, releasing the energy used for those particles as a burst of light. Producing a burst of light in someones face is bound to cause them to stumble back.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc79\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>To start the implementation, we need to come up with a way of prducing this burst of light. Since annihilation happens when combining opposing particle types, we need to create a certain amount of two opposing particle types and then perform a combine on them. The amount of particles we need is dependant on the strength of the effect. To produce a <em>Stumble</em> effect we need to produce a flash of light of about 1350 power. Annihilation produces light equal to the amount of particles combined, so to produce a burst of light of 1350 power we need to produce about 675 grains of both types of particle, as each grain of particles requires one power to produce.</p>\n\n<p>To put this all down on paper, we start off with a Begin glyph. Underneath that, we put a &quot;Create Particles&quot; glyph, picking &quot;Fire&quot; as the particle type and &quot;675 grains&quot; as the amount. We will need to store this value somewhere so that we can later use it for the combine operation, so we put a &quot;Put&quot; glyph to the top right of the &quot;Create Fire&quot;, picking the location &quot;Alpha&quot;. Underneath the &quot;Create Fire&quot; glyph, we put another &quot;Create Particles&quot; glyph, in this case picking &quot;Water&quot; as the type but using the same amount. We place a &quot;Put&quot; glyph to the top right of the &quot;Create Water&quot; to store the value again, this time picking &quot;Beta&quot; as the location.</p>\n\n<p>Underneath the &quot;Create Water&quot;, we now place a &quot;Combine&quot; glyph to perform the actual annihilation. &quot;Combine&quot; needs two values as input, so we put a &quot;Take&quot; glyph to the top right of the combine, picking &quot;Alpha&quot; for the location and we put a second &quot;Take&quot; to the bottom right of the combine, picking &quot;Beta&quot; for the location. These two glyphs will take the values from their respective locations and make them available for the &quot;Combine&quot; to use.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc80\">Final Implementation</h2>",

However, this matter only exists for a short while, eventually dissipating into the same nothing it came from. This process releases the energy of the matter back into the environment. This process is called radiation, as each particle decays and radiates away.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for primordial mages, this can negatively impact the environment. The exact reason is a subject of debate among the more scholarly mages, but the result is that sometimes, things go awry. Older mages have been known to grow tumours, lose their hair or even more radical things - including death. In addition, sometimes spells go wrong and instead of simply fizzling, create an anomaly.</p>\n\n<p>In game terms, this is represented by an instability score. One of the side effects of an newly inscribed spells can be to increase your instability score. If your instability score reaches 10, you should contact a GM.

      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Components</h1>\n  <p>Components are small things you can do or use to provide power to your automata when activating them. What components you have access to depends on your skills. You need to use at least one component to activate your automata.</p>\n\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, each component can be used only once per activation and each component requires exactly one second to use. In addition, only one component can be used at the same time, so you will have to string them together to use multiple components. Every component provides a certain amount of power as described by the component. Once finished using components you have five seconds to power an automata before the power is lost.</p>\n\n<p>Using components requires a certain amount of concentration, which means you can not fight, run or perform other phisically heavy tasks. If your concentration is broken, all power you gathered to activate the automata is lost and you need to start again. Note that components that are consumed when used for power will still be lost!</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc89\">Types of Components</h2>\n<p>Each component type represents a different source of power.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc90\">Verbal and Somatic</h3>\n<p>These are the most basic of components, that provide a little power even to an untrained apprentice. They represent an innate power source, the power of your own body. Both components are a way to access this power. The <em>Verbal</em> component is something like a spoken word, a short melody or even just a raw shout. The <em>Somatic</em> component is a gesture, like a hand wave, a piroutte or similar. Both components can be the same every time or something completely different per activation. Verbal and somatic components can be used at the same time, this is an exception to the normal rules of only allowing on use at a time.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc91\">Material</h3>\n<p>Material components are small amounts of matter that are consumed to provide power to your automata. They are simple things like a handful of sand or a cup of water, but also more elaborate things like a piece of silk or a specially crafted gold coin. Each material component provides an amount of power as described on the item card of that component. To use the component, perform an action with the material, preferrably something that indicates the material is being consumed. For example, in the case of a handful of sand you can sprinkle it around. You can use any amount of material components during activation, but each material component is consumed during use. Note that each material component still counts as a separate use, so using five materail components will take ten seconds.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc92\">Focus</h3>\n<p>A focus component is a specially crafted item that can be used to focus and channel the ambient energy around you. The amount of power provided is described on the item card. Focus components are not consumed when used. To use a focus component, wave it around it the air around you, touch it to the ground or perform some other action with the object to indicate the energy gathering.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc93\">Willpower</h3>\n<p>Willpower can be used to add power to your automata. To do so, choose an amount of willpower you want to expend. After concentrating for two seconds, you expend the amount of willpower. This will provide you 500 power for every willpower expended.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc94\">Hitpoints</h3>\n<p>Your own flesh and blood can be used to power your automata. To use this component, cut or otherwise damage yourself to become injured. You will drop to 0 hit points and receive 500 power. Note that this will not break your concentration like taking damage normally would. This process can be repeated once during the same activation, the second use drops you to -1 hitpoint and will also provide you with 500 power.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc95\">Special Components</h3>\n<p>There are several special components that are provided by skills, like &quot;Sacrifice Flesh&quot; or &quot;Power Reserve&quot;. The details of these components are described by the skills, but remember that unless otherwise noted, the normal rules apply to them.</p>\n\n  ",

The first type is Divine, which is a special form of energy that is primarily used by Divine magic, but certain spells need to use it as well. Most notably, it is needed for spells affecting emotions like fear. Divine particles always annihilate eachother. This means first and foremost that any combine operation on divine energy is always subtractive. Second, no glyphs can be divine-dominant, because such glyphs would disintegrate on first use. Lastly, care needs to be taken when handling larger amounts of Divine particles as they can become unstable and disrupt the rest of the automata.</p>\n\n<p>The second special type is Force. Force is a special type used in primordial magic that represents kinetic force. Contrary to Divine, Force is always additive. For dominance, any force dominant glyph may only manipulate force, no other elements are allowed. The exception to this is the apply() operation, which is allowed to be used with Force and any other type.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc97\">Annihilation</h3>\n<p>Annihilation is the process whereby two opposing particle types completely annihilate each other.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc98\">Units</h2>\n<p>These units are used to describe in-game quantities. Note that the in-game system uses base-6 for counting, denoted here with 0s. This means 0s10 equals 6, 0s100 equals 36, 0s55 equals 35, etc.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc99\">Volume</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Grain</strong><br>\nThe base unit and smallest amount of the system. The grain is defined as the minimum amount of matter needed to affect anything. It is approximately equal to the volume of a sphere of 5mm diameter or 65mm3.</li>\n    <li><strong>Pebble</strong><br>\n0s105 (41 in decimal) Grains, approximately a sphere of 2cm diameter.</li>\n    <li><strong>Fist</strong><br>\n0s43 (27 in decimal) Pebbles, approximately a sphere of 6cm diameter.<br>\n0s5043 (1107 in decimal) Grains.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc100\">Weight</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Grain</strong><br>\nThe weight of 1 Grain of Carbon. Approximately 0.15g.</li>\n    <li><strong>Stone</strong><br>\nThe weight of 1 Fist of Carbon. Approximately 256g.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc101\">Force</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Muscle</strong><br>\nThe amount of force needed to accelerate 1 Fist of Carbon so it moves 1 yard in 1 second.<br>\n1 Force particle produces 1 Muscle.<br>\nApproximately equal to 0.25 Joule.</li>\n    <li><strong>Strike</strong><br>\nThe amount of force that is delivered to a target by a sword strike. Equal to 0s1040 (240) Muscle.<br>\nApproximately equal to 60 Joule.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc102\">Time</h3>\n<p>For time we use the normal seconds, minutes, hours since things get way too complicated otherwise.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"toc103\">Length</h3>\n<p>For now, we simply use the traditional English units of measurement, inch, foot, yard and mile.</p>\n\n  ",

      "html": "\n  <h1 class=\"book-heading\">Downtime Periods</h1>\n  <p>The downtime system is entirely optional. You can choose not to allocate your resources and to simply ignore the entire system, in which case we will do it for you. If you don&apos;t care what your character does in between events you can stop reading now.</p>\n\n<p>Downtime is a period of time in which you do not actively play your character. Between games, or sometimes as a time skip within a game, some months of downtime might pass. During this time nothing of much interest happens to your character. Your character can use this time to make preparations for more challenging times. Characters regain all their HP and WP during downtime. You determine what happened during downtime once the downtime period has ended and you go back in character unless a GM tells you otherwise.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc0\">Resources</h2>\n<p>Every character gains 120 resources at the end of each month and you are allowed to spend all these points in one go at the start of the next event. These resources can be used to do all sorts of things like learning new skills, practicing the skills you already have, working a dayjob, or achieve other kinds of goals during downtime. Healing from an injury or other maladies also often costs resources.</p>\n\n<p>A resources is a very abstract way to measure the time, energy, social contacts, ingenuity, spare change, and other such things your character has to spend each month. But for some players it might help to think about resources as purely time. In that case 1 resource is about 2 to 4 hours.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc1\">Cost of living</h2>\n<p>Every month you lose 400 copper. This represents your character paying for its rent, food, travel expenses, clothing, etc. Most characters use a dayjob to pay for this.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc2\">Dayjob</h2>\n<p>Every resource you spend on your dayjob nets you 4 copper. This is unskilled work; almost everybody can find some form of unskilled work in Heimr. Most characters spend 100 resources on a dayjob to fund their cost of living.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc3\">Practicing skills you already have</h2>\n<p>Every month you will need to practice your skills or they will go dormant. Practicing skills with resources doesn&apos;t just take time, but also represents your character keeping his equipment in shape, visiting social contacts, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Practicing a skill costs 1 resource per point the skill costs. Most characters spend enough resources to practice all their skills so nothing goes dormant. You are not allowed to let a skill go dormant and retrain that skill in the same downtime period.</p>\n\n<p>Dormant skills cannot be used during play.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Conditions don&apos;t need to be practiced! Only skills!</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc4\">Training new skills</h2>\n<p>If you spend 20 resources per point on a new skill. You will have trained the skill. (some conditions can be gained in the same way).</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc5\">Retraining dormant skills</h2>\n<p>Retraining skills that have gone dormant is easier than training entirely new skills. It only costs 10 resources per point but otherwise works the same as training a new skill.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc6\">Other things to spend resources on</h2>\n<p>Some skills, conditions and items grant you the ability to spend resources on other things than the ones mentioned above. (For example; the crafting skills will give you the ability to craft items with resources). However if you want to spend resources on an activity that you think of yourself simply send an email to a game master and they will discuss it with you. For example; do you want to research the history of a specific deamon or do you want to spend time collecting rare coins or do you want to spend time in the pub listening to gossip, or anything else? Send an email!</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"toc7\">Items</h2>\n<p>You can buy and sell items during downtime. To buy an item, you must pay its market price. To sell an (undamaged) item you receive 50% of the market price. If your item is broken or damaged and you wish to repair it you must pay 50% of the market price unless a specific restore price is named on the item card. Please remember that if an item has a Market Price of <em>Var</em> it has special rules governing its market price and may be more difficult to buy or sell.</p>\n\n<p>There are cheaper ways to buy, sell or repair items. Ask characters about it; especially merchant or craftsmen.</p>\n\n  ",
