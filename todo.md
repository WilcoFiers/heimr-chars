## Handle custom rules

- "You receive a free Materal Compendium item when you acquire this skill."
- "If you have XX points worth of non-dormant skills or conditions in a single domain this condition is free."
- "You have an additional Xℜ each month."
- "Retraining dormant skills costs 5ℜ per point"
- "Once per month you can reduce the cost of training a skill with 7ℜ"
- "You gain the Sturdy Stance 1 skill and it costs 2ℜ less to maintain"

## Fix Heimr stuff
