- "If you have XX points worth of non-dormant skills or conditions in a single domain this condition is free."
- "In character creation, spend 14 extra points on dormant skills."
- "In character creation, spend 3pt on dormant skills"
- "You have an additional 6ℜ each month."
- "You have 5ℜ additional each month."
- "Retraining dormant skills costs 5ℜ per point"

- "You gain the Sturdy Stance 1 skill and it costs 2ℜ less to maintain"
