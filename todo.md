## Handle custom rules

- "You receive a free Materal Compendium item when you acquire this skill."
- "If you have XX points worth of non-dormant skills or conditions in a single domain this condition is free."
- "In character creation, spend 14 extra points on dormant skills."
- "In character creation, spend 3pt on dormant skills"
- "You have an additional 6ℜ each month."
- "You have 5ℜ additional each month."
- "Retraining dormant skills costs 5ℜ per point"
- "Once per month you can reduce the cost of training a skill with 7ℜ"
- "You gain the Sturdy Stance 1 skill and it costs 2ℜ less to maintain"

## Fix Heimr stuff

- Figure out which conditions can be bought during char creation
- How do you get a higher salary if you don't meet the "X points in a domain" requirement
